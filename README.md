## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications
A web application is an interactive platform that enables users to access dynamic features and conduct tasks, whereas a website offers static information. Web applications are used for certain tasks and user interactions, while websites are typically informational.

### VS Code & Extensions
VS Code is a well-known, open-source, lightweight, and potent source code editor. It includes a robust ecosystem of extensions, supports a wide range of programming languages, and provides debugging tools and version control integration.

Extensions are extra features that increase Visual Studio Code's capability. Support for many programming languages, themes, linters, debuggers, and tools like Docker and Git are just a few examples.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub
Version Control: is a system that tracks changes to files and enables multiple people to collaborate on a project without interfering with each other's work. It helps manage different versions of code, making it easier to review, revert, and merge changes.

Git: is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code, create branches for different features or bug fixes, and merge these changes back into the main codebase. Git keeps a complete history of the project and helps coordinate work across multiple developers.

GitHub: is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It allows developers to store and share their code, collaborate on projects, and manage version control remotely. GitHub provides additional features such as pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools, making it a popular choice for open-source and team-based development.

### Markdown & Documentation
Markdown is a simple markup language used to format plain text with easy-to-read syntax, commonly for writing documentation and README files. Documentation explains how software works, provides setup instructions, and guides users and developers. Markdown is widely used for creating clear and structured documentation because itâ€™s easy to write, read, and convert into formats like HTML.
